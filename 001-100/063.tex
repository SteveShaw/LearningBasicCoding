\section{63 --- Unique Paths II}
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a $m \times n$ grid (marked \textbf{Start} in the diagram below).
\par
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked \textbf{Finish} in the diagram below)
\par
Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
\par
An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $m$ and $n$ will be at most 100.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}
Same as Problem 62. The only difference is that for the obstacle, $F[i][j]=0$

\paragraph{Example 1:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}:
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix [matrix of nodes]
{
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\textbf{Output}: 2
\\
\textbf{Explanation}:
\\
There is one obstacle in the middle of the $3\times 3$ grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner
\begin{enumerate}
\item Right$\to$Right$\to$Down$\to$Down
\item Down$\to$Down$\to$Right$\to$Right
\end{enumerate}
