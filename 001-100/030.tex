\section{30 --- Substring with Concatenation of All Words}
You are given a string, $s$, and a list of words, $W$, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in $s$ that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $s = \texttt{barfoothefoobarman}$, $W = [\texttt{foo},\, \texttt{bar}]$

\textbf{Output}: $[0,\,9]$

\textbf{Explanation}: 

Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are \texttt{barfoor} and \texttt{foobar} respectively. 

The output order does not matter, returning $[9,\,0]$ is fine too.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Example 2:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $s = \texttt{wordgoodgoodgoodbestword}$, $W = [\texttt{word},\,\texttt{good},\,\texttt{best},\,\texttt{word}]$

\textbf{Output}: $[\,]$
\end{flushleft}
