\section{394 --- Decode String}
Given an encoded string $S$, return it's decoded string.
\par
The encoding rule is: $k[s]$, where the $s$ inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly $k$ times. Note that $k$ is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
\par
You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.
\par
Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like $3a$ or $2[4]$.

\paragraph{Examples:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $S = 3[a]2[bc]$, return \texttt{aaabcbc}.
\item $S = 3[a2[c]]$, return \texttt{accaccacc}.
\item $S = 2[abc]3[cd]ef$, return \texttt{abcabccdcdcdef}.
\end{itemize}
