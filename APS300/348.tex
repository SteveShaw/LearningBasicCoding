\section{348 --- Design Tic-Tac-Toe}

\textbf{Medium}

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a $n \times n$ grid.

You may assume the following rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
\item Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
\item A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Follow up:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Could you do better than $O(n^2)$ per \fcj{move()} operation?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{One Dimension Array}
We don't need to keep track of an entire $n^2$ board. We only need to keep a count for each row and column. If at any time a row or column matches the size of the board then that player has won.

To keep track of which player, Use 1 for Player1 and $-1$ for Player2. Each time a player places a piece we just need to check the count of that row, column, diagonal and anti-diagonal.
