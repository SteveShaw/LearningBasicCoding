\section{121 --- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock}
Say you have an array $P$ for which the $i$th element is the price of a given stock on day $i$.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
\paragraph{Example 1:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{[7,1,5,3,6,4]}

\textbf{Output}: 5

\textbf{Explanation}

Buy on day 2 (\fcj{price = 1}) and sell on day 5 (\fcj{price = 6}), \fcj{profit = 6 - 1 = 5}. Not $7-1 = 6$, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Example 2:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{[7,6,4,3,1]}

\textbf{Output}: 0

\textbf{Explanation}: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit is 0.
\end{flushleft}
\subsection{Minimum Price}

Suppose $x$ is the minimum price so far, then the possible maximum profit will be the difference between current price and $x$.

\setcounter{lstlisting}{0}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc, caption={One Pass}]
int maxProfit( vector<int>& prices )
{
    if( prices.empty() == 0 )
    {
        return 0;
    }
    int min_prc = prices[0];
    int max_profit = 0;
    for( size_t i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i )
    {
        if( min_prc < prices[i] )
        {
            min_prc = prices[i];
        }
        else if( prices[i] - min_prc > max_profit )
        {
            max_profit = prices[i] - min_prc;
        }
    }
    return max_profit;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Kadane Algorithm}
The logic to solve this problem is same as \textit{maximum subarray problem} using \textbf{Kadane Algorithm}. If the question is changed slightly by giving the difference array of prices, For example: for a given array \fcj{[1,7,,4,11]}, the problem could give the difference as \fcj{[0,6,-3,7]}. Here, the logic is to calculate the difference $( D = D + P[i] - P[i-1])$ of the original array, and find a contiguous subarray giving maximum profit. If the difference falls below 0, reset it to zero.
