\section{167 --- Two Sum II: Input array is sorted}
Given an array of integers $A$ that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number $T$.
\par
The function should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where the first index $\alpha$ must be less than the second index $\beta$.
\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Your returned answers (both $\alpha$ and $\beta$) are not zero-based.
    \item You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Example:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $A = [2,7,11,15]$, $T = 9$
\\
\textbf{Output}: $[1,2]$
\\
\textbf{Explanation}: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = 2$.
\end{flushleft}
