\section{167 --- Two Sum II: Input array is sorted}
Given an array of integers $A$ that is already \textbf{sorted in ascending order}, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number $T$.

The function should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where the first index \fcj{index1} must be less than the second index \fcj{index2}.
\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Your returned answers (both \fcj{index1} and \fcj{index2}) are not zero-based.
    \item You may assume that each input would have \textit{exactly} one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Example:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $A$: \fcj{[2,7,11,15]}, \fcj{target = 9}

\textbf{Output}: $[1,2]$

\textbf{Explanation}: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore \fcj{index1 = 1}, \fcj{index2 = 2}.
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Two Pointers}
Using \fcj{left} and \fcj{right} to traverse from both ends of $A$.
