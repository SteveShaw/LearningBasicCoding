\section{333 --- Largest BST Subtree}
Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.
\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A subtree must include all of its descendants. 
\end{itemize}
\par
Here's an example:
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}
[my/.style={draw, circle, fill=gray!20!, minimum size=5mm}]
\node[my](1) at (0,0) {10};
\node[my](2)[below=8mm of 1, xshift=-12mm] {\textcolor{red}{5}};
\node[my](3)[below=8mm of 1, xshift=12mm] {15};
\node[my](4)[below=8mm of 2, xshift=-10mm] {\textcolor{red}{1}};
\node[my](5)[below=8mm of 2, xshift=10mm] {\textcolor{red}{8}};
\node[my](6)[below=8mm of 3, xshift=10mm] {7};
\draw[thick] (1) -- (2);
\draw[thick] (1) -- (3);
\draw[thick] (2) -- (4);
\draw[thick] (2) -- (5);
\draw[thick] (3) -- (6);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one. 
\par
The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.

\paragraph{Hint:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You can recursively use algorithm similar to 98. Validate Binary Search Tree at each node of the tree, which will result in $O(n\log n)$ time complexity.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Follow up:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can you figure out ways to solve it with $O(n)$ time complexity?
\end{itemize}
