\section{660 --- Remove 9}
Start from integer 1, remove any integer that contains 9 such as 9, 19, 29.

So now, you will have a new integer sequence: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, \ldots$

Given a positive integer $n$, you need to return the $n$-th integer after removing. Note that 1 will be the first integer.

\paragraph{Example 1:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: 9

\textbf{Output}: 10
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Hint:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n$ will not exceed $9 \times 10^8$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mathematical}
Let's write the first numbers and try to notice a pattern. Those numbers are:
\begin{align*}
& 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \\
& 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,\\
& 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, \ldots \\
& 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, \\
& 100, 101, 102, \ldots
\end{align*}

These numbers look exactly like all base-9 numbers!

Indeed, every base-9 number is a number in this sequence, and every number in this sequence is a base-9 number. Both this sequence and the sequence of all base-9 numbers are in increasing order. The answer is therefore just the $n$-th base-9 number.
