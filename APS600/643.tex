\section{643 --- Maximum Average Subarray I}
Given an array consisting of $n$ integers, $A$, find the contiguous subarray of given length $k$ that has the maximum average value. And you need to output the maximum average value.

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $[1,12,-5,-6,50,3]$, $k = 4$

\textbf{Output}: 12.75

\textbf{Explanation}: Maximum average is $(12-5-6+50)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75$

\end{flushleft}
 

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \leq k \leq n \leq 30,000$.
\item Elements of the given array will be in the range $[-10,000, 10,000]$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sliding Window}
Assume that we already know the sum of elements from index $i$ to index $i+k$, say it is $x$.

Now, to determine the sum of elements from the index $i+1$ to the index $i+k+1$, all we need to do is to subtract the element $A[i]$ from $x$ and to add the element $A[i+k+1]$ to $x$. We can carry out our process based on this idea and determine the maximum possible average.
