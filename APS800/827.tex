\section{827 --- Making A Large Island}

\textbf{Hard}

In a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, we change at most one 0 to a 1.

After, what is the size of the largest island? (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s).

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{[[1, 0], [0, 1]]}

\textbf{Output}: 3

\textbf{Explanation}: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with \fcj{area = 3}.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Example 2:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{[[1, 1], [1, 0]]}

\textbf{Output}: 4

\textbf{Explanation}: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with \fcj{area = 4}.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Example 3:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{[[1, 1], [1, 1]]}

\textbf{Output}: 4

\textbf{Explanation}: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with \fcj{area = 4}.
\end{flushleft}

 

\paragraph{Notes:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \leq \texttt{grid.length = grid[0].length} \leq 50$.
\item $0 \leq \texttt{grid[i][j]} \leq 1$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Depth First Search}
To avoid calculate each connected component repeatedly, we can mark each component with a unique color, add the size of this component into an array and associate the index with the color. In this way, we can easily find if two cells with value 1 belong to same group.
