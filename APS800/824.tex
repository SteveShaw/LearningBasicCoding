\section{824 --- Goat Latin}

\textbf{Easy}

A sentence $S$ is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to \fcj{"Goat Latin"} (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)

The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append \fcj{"ma"} to the end of the word. For example, the word \fcj{'apple'} becomes \fcj{'applema'}.
     
\item If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add \fcj{"ma"}. For example, the word \fcj{"goat"} becomes \fcj{"oatgma"}.
     
\item Add one letter \fcj{'a'} to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1. For example, the first word gets \fcj{"a"} added to the end, the second word gets \fcj{"aa"} added to the end and so on.
\end{itemize}

Return the final sentence representing the conversion from $S$ to Goat Latin. 

 

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{"I speak Goat Latin"}

\textbf{Output}: \fcj{"Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"}
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Example 2:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"}

\textbf{Output}: 

``heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa''

\end{flushleft}
 

\paragraph{Notes:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ contains only uppercase, lowercase and spaces. Exactly one space between each word.
\item $1 \leq \lvert S\rvert \leq 150$.
\end{itemize}
