\section{848 --- Shifting Letters}

\textbf{Medium}

We have a string $S$ of lowercase letters, and an integer array shifts.

Call the shift of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that \fcj{'z'} becomes \fcj{'a'}). 

For example, \fcj{shift('a') = 'b'}, \fcj{shift('t') = 'u'}, and \fcj{shift('z') = 'a'}.

Now for each \fcj{shifts[i] = x}, we want to shift the first $i+1$ letters of $S$, $x$ times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to $S$ are applied.

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{S = "abc"}, \fcj{shifts = [3,5,9]}

\textbf{Output}: \fcj{"rpl"}

\textbf{Explanation}: 

We start with \fcj{"abc"}.

After shifting the first 1 letters of $S$ by 3, we have \fcj{"dbc"}.

After shifting the first 2 letters of $S$ by 5, we have \fcj{"igc"}.

After shifting the first 3 letters of $S$ by 9, we have \fcj{"rpl"}, the answer.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \leq \texttt{S.length = shifts.length} \leq 20000$
\item $0 \leq \texttt{shifts[i]} \leq 10 ^ 9$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prefix Sum}
The $i$th character is shifted $\texttt{shifts}[i] + \texttt{shifts}[i+1] + ... + \texttt{shifts}[\texttt{shifts.length} - 1]$ times. That's because only operations at the $i$th operation and after, affect the $i$th character.
