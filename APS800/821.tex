\section{821 --- Shortest Distance to a Character}

\textbf{Easy}

Given a string $S$ and a character $C$, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character $C$ in the string.

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{S = "loveleetcode"}, \fcj{C = 'e'}

\textbf{Output}: \fcj{[3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]}
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ string length is in \fcj{[1, 10000]}.
\item $C$ is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string $S$.
\item All letters in $S$ and $C$ are lowercase.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Two Pass}
For each \fcj{S[i]}, we find the distance to the next character $C$ going left, and going right. The answer is the minimum of these two values.

When going left to right, we'll remember the index \fcj{prev} of the last character $C$ we've seen. Then the answer is \fcj{i - prev}.

When going right to left, we'll remember the index \fcj{prev} of the last character $C$ we've seen. Then the answer is \fcj{prev - i}.

We take the minimum of these two answers to create our final answer.
