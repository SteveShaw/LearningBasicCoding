\section{839 --- Similar String Groups}

\textbf{Hard}

Two strings $X$ and $Y$ are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of $X$, so that it equals $Y$. Also two strings $X$ and $Y$ are similar if they are equal.

For example, \fcj{"tars"} and \fcj{"rats"} are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and \fcj{"rats"} and \fcj{"arts"} are similar, but \fcj{"star"} is not similar to \fcj{"tars"}, \fcj{"rats"}, or \fcj{"arts"}.

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: \fcj{("tars", "rats", "arts")} and \fcj{("star")}.  Notice that \fcj{"tars"} and \fcj{"arts"} are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list $A$ of strings.  Every string in $A$ is an anagram of every other string in A.  How many groups are there?

 

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{A = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]}

\textbf{Output}: 2
\end{flushleft}
 

\paragraph{Constraints:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \leq \texttt{A.length} \leq 2000$
\item $ 1 \leq \texttt{A[i].length} \leq 1000 $
\item $\texttt{A.length} \ast \texttt{A[i].length} \leq 20000$
\item All words in $A$ consist of lowercase letters only.
\item All words in $ A $ have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
\item The judging time limit has been increased for this question.
