\section{822 --- Card Flipping Game}

\textbf{Medium}

On a table are $N$ cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different).

We flip any number of cards, and after we choose one card. 

If the number $X$ on the back of the chosen card is not on the front of any card, then this number $X$ is good.

What is the smallest number that is good?  If no number is good, output 0.

Here, \fcj{fronts[i]} and \fcj{backs[i]} represent the number on the front and back of card $i$. 

A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa.

\paragraph{Example:}
\begin{flushleft}

\textbf{Input}: \fcj{fronts = [1,2,4,4,7]}, \fcj{backs = [1,3,4,1,3]}

\textbf{Output}: 2

\textbf{Explanation}: 

If we flip the second card, the fronts are \fcj{[1,3,4,4,7]} and the backs are \fcj{[1,2,4,1,3]}.

We choose the second card, which has number 2 on the back, and it isn't on the front of any card, so 2 is good.

\end{flushleft}
 

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \fcj{1 <= fronts.length == backs.length <= 1000}.
\item \fcj{1 <= fronts[i] <= 2000}.
\item \fcj{1 <= backs[i] <= 2000}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hash Set}
If a card has the same value $x$ on the front and back, it is impossible to win with $x$. Otherwise, it has two different values, and if we win with $x$, we can put $x$ face down on the rest of the cards.
