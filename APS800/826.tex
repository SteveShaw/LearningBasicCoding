\section{826 --- Most Profit Assigning Work}

\textbf{Medium}

We have jobs: \fcj{difficulty[i]} is the difficulty of the $i$th job, and \fcj{profit[i]} is the profit of the $i$th job. 

Now we have some workers. \fcj{worker[i]} is the ability of the $i$th worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most \fcj{worker[i]}. 

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

For example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays \$1, then the total profit will be \$3.  If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is \$0.

What is the most profit we can make?

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: 

\fcj{difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10]}, 

\fcj{profit = [10,20,30,40,50]}, 

\fcj{worker = [4,5,6,7]}

\textbf{Output}: 100 

\textbf{Explanation}: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty \fcj{[4,4,6,6]} and they get profit of \fcj{[20,20,30,30]} separately.

\paragraph{Notes:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \leq \texttt{difficulty.length} = \texttt{profit.length} \leq 10000$
\item $1 \leq \texttt{worker.length} \leq 10000$
\item \fcj{difficulty[i]}, \fcj{profit[i]}, \fcj{worker[i]}  are in range $[1, 10^5]$
\end{itemize}
