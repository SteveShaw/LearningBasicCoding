\section{791 --- Custom Sort String}
$S$ and $T$ are strings composed of lowercase letters. In $S$, no letter occurs more than once.

$S$ was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of $T$ so that they match the order that $S$ was sorted. More specifically, if $x$ occurs before $y$ in $S$, then $x$ should occur before $y$ in the returned string.

Return any permutation of $T$ (as a string) that satisfies this property.

\paragraph{Example:}
\begin{flushleft}


\textbf{Input}: 

\fcj{S = "cba"}

\fcj{T = "abcd"}

\textbf{Output}: \fcj{"cbad"}

\textbf{Explanation}: 

\fcj{"a"}, \fcj{"b"}, \fcj{"c"} appear in $S$, so the order of \fcj{"a"}, \fcj{"b"}, \fcj{"c"} should be \fcj{"c"}, \fcj{"b"}, and \fcj{"a"}.
 
Since \fcj{"d"} does not appear in $S$, it can be at any position in $T$. \fcj{"dcba"}, \fcj{"cdba"}, \fcj{"cbda"} are also valid outputs.
 
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in $S$.
\item $T$ has length at most 200.
\item $S$ and $T$ consist of lowercase letters only.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Count And Write}
First, count elements in $T$ and then traversing $S$. write those elements in the order in $S$. Then add those letters do not appear in $S$.

    string ans;
    ans.reserve( T.size() );
    for( auto c : S )
    {
        if( dict[c - 'a'] > 0 )
        {
            //we add this letter first
            ans.append( dict[c - 'a'], c );
            dict[c - 'a'] = 0;
        }
    }
    //then add letters do not appear in S
    for( int i = 0; i < 26; ++i )
    {
        if( dict[i] > 0 )
        {
            ans.append( dict[i], 'a' + i );
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
