\section{765 --- Couples Holding Hands}
$N$ couples sit in $2N$ seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands. We want to know the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

The people and seats are represented by an integer from 0 to $ 2N-1 $, the couples are numbered in order, the first couple being $ (0, 1) $, the second couple being $ (2, 3) $, and so on with the last couple being $ (2N-2, 2N-1) $.

The couples' initial seating is given by \fcj{row[i]} being the value of the person who is initially sitting in the $i$-th seat.

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{row = [0, 2, 1, 3]}

\textbf{Output}: 1

\textbf{Explanation}: We only need to swap the second (\fcj{row[1]}) and third (\fcj{row[2]}) person.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Example 2:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \fcj{row = [3, 2, 0, 1]}

\textbf{Output}: 0

\textbf{Explanation}: All couples are already seated side by side.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \fcj{len(row)} is even and in the range of \fcj{[4, 60]}.
\item \fcj{row} is guaranteed to be a permutation of \fcj{0...len(row)-1}.
\end{itemize}
