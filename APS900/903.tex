\section{903 --- Valid Permutations for DI Sequence}

\textbf{Hard}

We are given $S$, a length $n$ string of characters from the set \fcc{{'D', 'I'}}. (These letters stand for \textit{decreasing} and \textit{increasing}.)

A valid permutation is a permutation $P[0]$, $P[1]$, $\ldots$, $P[n]$ of integers $\{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$, such that for all $i$:

\begin{itemize}
\item If \fcj{S[i] == 'D'}, then $P[i] > P[i+1]$, and;
\item If \fcj{S[i] == 'I'}, then $P[i] < P[i+1]$.
\end{itemize}

How many valid permutations are there?  Since the answer may be large, return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: "DID"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The 5 valid permutations of (0, 1, 2, 3) are:
(1, 0, 3, 2)
(2, 0, 3, 1)
(2, 1, 3, 0)
(3, 0, 2, 1)
(3, 1, 2, 0)

 

Note:

    1 <= S.length <= 200
    S consists only of characters from the set {'D', 'I'}.
