\section{526 --- Beautiful Arrangement}
Suppose you have $ N $ integers from 1 to $N$. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these $ N $ numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the $ i $-th position ($1 \leq i \leq N$) in this array:

 \begin{itemize}
\item The number at the $ i $-th position is divisible by $ i $.
\item $ i $ is divisible by the number at the $ i $-th position.

\end{itemize}
 

Now given $N$, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: 2

\textbf{Output}: 2

\textbf{Explanation}: 

The first beautiful arrangement is $[1, 2]$:

Number at the 1st position ($ i=1 $) is 1, and 1 is divisible by $ i $ ($ i=1 $).

Number at the 2nd position ($ i=2 $) is 2, and 2 is divisible by $ i $ ($ i=2 $).

The second beautiful arrangement is $ [2, 1] $:

Number at the 1st position ($ i=1 $) is 2, and 2 is divisible by $ i $ ($ i=1 $).

Number at the 2nd position ($ i=2 $) is 1, and $ i $ ($ i=2 $) is divisible by 1.

 
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item  $ N $ is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.
\end{itemize}
