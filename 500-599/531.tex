\section{531 --- Lonely Pixel I}
Given a picture $G$ consisting of black and white pixels, find the number of black lonely pixels.

The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of \texttt{B} and \texttt{W}, which means black and white pixels respectively.

A black lonely pixel is character \texttt{B} that located at a specific position where the same row and same column don't have any other black pixels.

\paragraph{Example:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\texttt{W} & \texttt{W} & \texttt{B}\\
 \texttt{W} & \texttt{B} & \texttt{W}\\
 \texttt{B} & \texttt{W} & \texttt{W}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\textbf{Output}: 3

\textbf{Explanation}: All the three \texttt{B}s are black lonely pixels.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item  The range of width and height of the input 2D array is $ [1,500] $.
\end{itemize}
