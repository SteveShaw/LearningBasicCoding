\section{523 --- Continuous Subarray Sum}
Given a list of non-negative numbers $A$ and a target integer $k$, write a function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2 that sums up to a multiple of $k$, that is, sums up to $n\times k$ where $n$ is also an integer.

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $ A = [23, 2, 4, 6, 7] $,  $ k=6 $

\textbf{Output}: \texttt{true}

\textbf{Explanation}: 

Because [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Example 2:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $[23, 2, 6, 4, 7]$,  $ k=6 $

\textbf{Output}: \texttt{true}

\textbf{Explanation}: 

Because $[23, 2, 6, 4, 7]$ is an continuous subarray of size 5 and sums up to 42.

\end{flushleft}

 

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item The length of the array won't exceed 10,000.
\item You may assume the sum of all the numbers is in the range of a signed 32-bit integer.
\end{itemize}
