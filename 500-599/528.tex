\section{528 --- Random Pick with Weight}
Given an array $w$ of positive integers, where $w[i]$ describes the weight of index $i$, write a function \texttt{pickIndex} which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \leq \lvert w\rvert \leq 10000$
\item $1 \leq w[i] \leq 10^5$
\item \texttt{pickIndex} will be called at most 10000 times.
\end{itemize}
