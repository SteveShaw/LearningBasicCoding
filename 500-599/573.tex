\section{573 --- Squirrel Simulation}
There's a tree, a squirrel, and several nuts. Positions are represented by the cells in a 2D grid. Your goal is to find the \textbf{minimal} distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one. The squirrel can only take at most \textbf{one nut} at one time and can move in four directions -- up, down, left and right, to the adjacent cell. The distance is represented by the number of moves.

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: 

$H:=5$, $W:=7$, 

Tree position : $[2,2]$

Squirrel : $[4,4]$

Nuts : $[[3,0], [2,5]]$

\textbf{Output}: 12

\textbf{Explanation}:
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (7, 5);
\node[bob] at (4.5, 0.5) {};
\node at (5.5,2.5) {\Coffeecup[2]};
\node at (0.5,1.5) {\Coffeecup[2]};
\node at (2.5, 2.5) {\Springtree[2]};
\draw[>=stealth, ->] (5,0.5) -| (5.5, 1.8) node[pos=0.80, right] {1};
\draw[>=stealth, ->] (5,2.5) -> (3.2, 2.5) node[midway, above] {2};
\draw[>=stealth, ->] (2,2.5) -| (0.5, 2.1) node[pos=0.25, above] {3};
\draw[>=stealth, ->] (1,1.5) -| (2.5, 1.9) node[pos=0.25, below] {4};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item All given positions won't overlap.
\item The squirrel can take at most one nut at one time.
\item The given positions of nuts have no order.
\item Height, $H$, and Width, $W$, are positive integers. $3 \leq H\times W \leq 10,000$.
\item The given positions contain at least one nut, only one tree and one squirrel.
\end{itemize}
