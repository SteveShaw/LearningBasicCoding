\section{533 --- Lonely Pixel II}
Given a picture $G$ consisting of black and white pixels, and a positive integer $N$, find the number of black pixels located at some specific row \textbf{R} and column \textbf{C} that align with all the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item Row R and column C both contain exactly $ N $ black pixels.
\item For all rows that have a black pixel at column \textbf{C}, they should be exactly the same as row \textbf{R}
\end{itemize}

The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of \textbf{B} and \textbf{W}, which means black and white pixels respectively.

\paragraph{Example:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: 
                                           
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
W & B & W & B & B & W \\   
W & B & W & B & B & W \\
W & B & W & B & B & W \\
W & W & B & W & B & W
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

$ N = 3 $

\textbf{Output}: 6

\textbf{Explanation}: All the red \textbf{B} are the black pixels we need (all \textbf{B}s at column 1 and 3).

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{l|cccccc}
 & 0 &   1&    2 &   3 &   4 &   5 \\
\hline
0 &   W & \textcolor{red}{B} & W & \textcolor{red}{B} & B & W \\    
1  &   W & \textcolor{red}{B} & W & \textcolor{red}{B} & B & W \\    
2  &   W & \textcolor{red}{B} & W & \textcolor{red}{B} & B & W \\    
3  &   W & W & B & W & B & W 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}  

Take \textbf{B} at row $ R = 0 $ and column $ C = 1 $ as an example:

\textbf{Rule 1}: row $ R = 0 $ and column $ C = 1 $ both have exactly $ N = 3 $ black pixels. 

\textbf{Rule 2}, the rows have black pixel at column $ C = 1 $ are row 0, row 1 and row 2. They are exactly the same as row $ R = 0 $.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item  The range of width and height of the input 2D array is $[1,200]$
\end{itemize}.
