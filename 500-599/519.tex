\section{519 --- Random Flip Matrix}
You are given the number of rows $M$ and number of columns $N$ of a 2D binary matrix where all values are initially 0. Write a function \texttt{flip} which chooses a 0 value uniformly at random, changes it to 1, and then returns the position $(r,c)$ of that value. Also, write a function reset which sets all values back to 0. Try to minimize the number of calls to system's \texttt{Math}.\texttt{random}() and optimize the time and space complexity.

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item $1 \leq M, N \leq 10000$
\item $0\leq r < M$ and $0\leq c < N$
\item Flip will not be called when the matrix has no 0 values left.
\item The total number of calls to flip and reset will not exceed 1000.
\end{itemize}
