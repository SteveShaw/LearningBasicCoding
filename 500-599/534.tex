\section{535 --- Encode and Decode TinyURL}
\paragraph{Note:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item This is a companion problem to the \textbf{System Design problem}: \textbf{Design TinyURL}.
\end{itemize}

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as \url{https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl} and it returns a short URL such as \url{http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk}.

Design the \texttt{encode} and \texttt{decode} methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.
