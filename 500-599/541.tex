\section{541 --- Reverse String II}
Given a string $s$ and an integer $k$, you need to reverse the first $k$ characters for every $2k$ characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than $k$ characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than $2k$ but greater than or equal to $k$ characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

\paragraph{Example:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $s = \texttt{abcdefg}$, $k = 2$

\textbf{Output}: \texttt{bacdfeg}
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Restrictions:}

\begin{itemize}
\item The string consists of lower English letters only.
\item Length of the given string and $k$ will in the range $[1, 10000]$
\end{itemize}
