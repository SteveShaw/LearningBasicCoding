\section{451 --- Sort Characters By Frequency}
Given a string $s$, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \texttt{tree}

\textbf{Output}: \texttt{eert}

\textbf{Explanation}:

\texttt{e} appears twice while \texttt{r} and \texttt{t} both appear once.

So \texttt{e} must appear before both \texttt{r} and \texttt{t}. Therefore \texttt{eetr} is also a valid answer.

\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Example 2:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \texttt{cccaaa}

\textbf{Output}: \texttt{cccaaa}

\textbf{Explanation}:

Both \texttt{c} and \texttt{a} appear three times, so \texttt{aaaccc} is also a valid answer.

Note that \texttt{cacaca} is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

\end{flushleft}


\paragraph{Example 3:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \texttt{Aabb}

\textbf{Output}: \texttt{bbAa}

\textbf{Explanation}:

\texttt{bbaA} is also a valid answer, but \texttt{Aabb} is incorrect.

Note that \texttt{A} and \texttt{a} are treated as two different characters.
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Bucket Sort}
\begin{itemize}
\item The maximum frequency of a character in $s$ is the length of $s$, say $\ell$. Therefore we can create $\ell$ buckets to put same frequency characters into one bucket.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc, caption={Bucket Sort}]
string frequencySort( string s )
{
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
    //put characters with x frequence
    //into buckets[x-1]
    vector<string> buckets( s.size() );

    for( auto c : s )
    {
        m[c] += 1;
    }

    for( const auto& p : m )
    {
        int count = p.second;
        char c = p.first;
        //add count of c into buckets[count-1]
        buckets[count - 1].append( count, c );
    }

    string ans;
    //buckets[i] has frequence i+1
    //therefore we need to group the letters
    //from end of bucket
    for( size_t i = s.size(); i >= 1 ; --i )
    {
        if( !buckets[i - 1].empty() )
        {
            //only add non-empty
            //bucket
            ans += buckets[i - 1];
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
