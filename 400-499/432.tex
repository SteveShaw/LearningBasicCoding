\section{432 --- All O`one Data Structure}
Implement a data structure supporting the following operations:


\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
/*
Inserts a new key with value 1. 
Or increments an existing key by 1. 
Key is guaranteed to be a non-empty string.
*/
Inc(Key) 

/*
If Key's value is 1, remove it from the data structure. 
Otherwise decrements an existing key by 1. 
If the key does not exist,this function does nothing. 
Key is guaranteed to be a non-empty string.
*/
Dec(Key)

/*
Returns one of the keys with maximal value. 
If no element exists, return an empty string.
*/

GetMaxKey()

/*
Returns one of the keys with minimal value. 
If no element exists, return an empty string
*/
GetMinKey()
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Challenge:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Perform all these in $O(1)$ time complexity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hash Map With Double Linked List}
\begin{itemize}
\item We use a struct \texttt{Bucket} to store the value and the associated keys.
\item Store the buckets in a double linked list, $L$, and associate the key with the position of its bucket in the list through a hash map, $M$.
\item We put the bucket with the least value at the end of the list, and the bucket with largest value in the front.
\item When the value of the key is changed, we have to check their previous or successive bucket to see if the value inside is either 1 greater or 1 smaller than current value of the key. If not, we have to create a new bucket to store the new value and the key. Also, remove the key from it's current bucket and change the hash map when possible.
\end{itemize}
