\section{406 --- Queue Reconstruction by Height}
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers $(h, k)$, where $h$ is the height of the person and $k$ is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of people is less than 1,100.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $[\; [7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]\;]$
\\
\textbf{Output}: $[\;[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]\;]$
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Sort}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sort the input list by the height from larger to smaller. If two persons have same heights, the one with smaller $k$ is placed in front.
\item Starting from the second person in the sorted list, maintains a counter $\delta$ that records how many persons in front have a height greater than or equal to current person:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For current person $i$, for any person $j$ in front of $i$, if $h_j \geq h_i$, increments the counter $\delta$. 
\item If $\delta$ equal to $k_i$, from $i-1$ to $j$, we swap each element with its previous one. When this process is completed, put $i$ into $j$ and this will place $i$ into the correct position
\item Then stop and continue to person $i+1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
