\section{467 --- Unique Substrings in Wraparound String}
Consider the string $s$ to be the infinite wraparound string of \texttt{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}, so $s$ will look like this:  $\ldots \texttt{zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd} \ldots$.

Now we have another string $p$. Your job is to find out how many unique non-empty substrings of $p$ are present in $s$. In particular, your input is the string $p$ and you need to output the number of different non-empty substrings of $p$ in the string $s$.

\paragraph{Note:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item $p$ consists of only lowercase English letters and the size of $p$ might be over 10000.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example 1:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \texttt{a}

\textbf{Output}: 1

\textbf{Explanation}: Only the substring a of string \texttt{a} is in the string.

\end{flushleft}


\paragraph{Example 2:}
\begin{flushleft}

\textbf{Input}: \texttt{cac}

\textbf{Output}: 2

\textbf{Explanation}: There are two substrings \texttt{a}, \texttt{c} of string \texttt{cac} in the string \texttt{s}.


\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Example 3:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: \texttt{zab}

\textbf{Output}: 6

\textbf{Explanation}: There are six substrings \texttt{z}, \texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{za}, \texttt{ab}, \texttt{zab} of string \texttt{zab} in the string $s$.
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}
The idea is, if we know the max number of unique substrings in $p$ ends with $a, b, \ldots, z$, then add them together will be the answer. 

\begin{itemize}
\item The max number of unique substring ends with a letter equals to the length of max contiguous substring ends with that letter. For example \texttt{abcd}, the max number of unique substring ends with $d$ is 4, apparently they are \texttt{abcd}, \texttt{bcd}, \texttt{cd} and \texttt{d}.
\item If there are overlapping, we only need to consider the longest one because it covers all the possible substrings. For example: \texttt{abcdbcd}, the max number of unique substring ends with $d$ is 4 and all substrings formed by the 2nd \texttt{bcd} part are covered in the 4 substrings already.
\item No matter how long is a contiguous substring in $p$, it must be in $s$ because $s$ is infinite.
\end{itemize}
