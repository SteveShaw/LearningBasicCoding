\section{412 --- Fizz Buzz}
Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to $ n $.
\par
But for multiples of three it should output \texttt{Fizz} instead of the number and for the multiples of five output \texttt{Buzz}. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output FizzBuzz.

\paragraph{Example:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: 15
\\
\textbf{Output}: $[\;1,2,\texttt{Fizz}, 4, \texttt{Bizz}, \texttt{Fizz}, 7, 8, \texttt{Fizz}, \texttt{Buzz}, 11, \texttt{Fizz}, 13, 14, \texttt{FizzBuzz}\;]$
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{String Concatenation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Initially set current string is empty
\item If current number can be divide by 3, add \texttt{Fizz}
\item If current number can be divide by 5, add \texttt{Buzz}
\item If the string is still empty, the current number cannot be divided by 3 and 5, so set the string to current number itself
\end{itemize}
