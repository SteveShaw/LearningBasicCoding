\section{463 --- Island Perimeter}
You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have \texttt{lakes} (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

 

\paragraph{Example:}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
 1 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]



\textbf{Output}: 16

\textbf{Explanation}: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}
[thick]
\draw (0,0) grid (4,4);
\draw[fill=red!60!green!30!] (1,3) rectangle ++(1,1);
\draw[fill=red!60!green!30!] (1,2) rectangle ++(1,1);
\draw[fill=red!60!green!30!] (1,1) rectangle ++(1,1);
\draw[fill=red!60!green!30!] (1,0) rectangle ++(1,1);
\draw[fill=red!60!green!30!] (0,0) rectangle ++(1,1);
\draw[fill=red!60!green!30!] (0,2) rectangle ++(1,1);
\draw[fill=red!60!green!30!] (2,2) rectangle ++(1,1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Depth Fist Search}

\begin{itemize}
\item To indicate a cell $G[x][y]$ is visited, we can change the value of this cell to a different value like 2.
\item This problem is to find the perimeter. For current cell $G[x][y]$, if it is surrounded by water, the perimeter will be 4. we check its four adjacent cells. If any one of them is also an island (either the value is 1 or 2), decrements the perimeter.
\item We recursively compute for any adjacent island that has not been visited.
\end{itemize}
