\section{207 --- Course Schedule}
There are a total of $n$ courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to $n-1$.
\par
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: $[0,1]$
\par
Given the total number of courses $n$ and a list of prerequisite pairs $P$, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
\paragraph{Example 1:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $2$, $[[1,0]]$
\\
\textbf{Output}: \texttt{true}
\\
\textbf{Explanation}:
\\
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
\end{flushleft}
\paragraph{Example 2:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: $2$, $[[1,0],[0,1]]$
\\
\textbf{Output}: \texttt{false}
\\
\textbf{Explanation}:
\\
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
\end{flushleft}
\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
    \item You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{DFS}
To detect cycle in directed graph, mark the visited node as one color number like 1. And then if there is a cycle, some nodes that has already been colored as $1$ could be meeted again. If there is no cycle, Otherwise, after the DFS is done for this starting node, mark this node as another color number like 2.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State $\star$ $P$ is the prerequisite pair array with length $L$ and $L$ may not equal to $n$
\Procedure{CanFinish}{$n, P, L$}

\State $\star$ Create a array $x$ which records each node's marked color, initially, all nodes are colored as 0

\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Function \texttt{DFS} color each node by number 2. Before the depth first search process, the starting node is marked by number 1. If a node marked by number 1 meet again, there is a cycle in the graph.

\State \Return \texttt{false}

\subsection{BFS}
The idea is to simply use \textbf{Topological Sorting}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Get in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the graph and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.
    \item Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue $Q$
    \item Pop a vertex from $Q$ and then
    \begin{itemize}
        \item increment count of visited nodes by 1. 
        \item Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
    \item If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to $Q$.
\end{itemize}
\item Repeat 3 until $Q$ is empty.
\item If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph, then there exits a cycle.
\end{enumerate}

\Procedure{CanFinish}{$n, P, L$}
\State $\star$ Build a adjacent graph structure $G$ from $P$
