\section{281 --- Zigzag Iterator}
Given two 1d vectors $A$ and $B$, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.
\par
For example, given two 1d vectors:
$A = [1, 2]$ and $B = [3, 4, 5, 6]$
\par
By calling \texttt{next} repeatedly until \texttt{hasNext} returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: $[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]$.
\paragraph{Follow up:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Clarification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{Zigzag} order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for $k > 2$ cases. If \texttt{Zigzag} does not look right to you, replace \texttt{Zigzag} with \texttt{Cyclic}. For example, given the following input:
\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{l}
        $[1,2,3]$   \\
        $[4,5,6,7]$ \\
        $[8,9]$
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
It should return $[1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7]$.
\end{itemize}
