\section{243 --- Shortest Word Distance}
Given a list of words $W$ and two words $A$ and $B$, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
\par
For example,Assume that $W$ = [\texttt{practice}, \texttt{makes}, \texttt{perfect}, \texttt{coding}, \texttt{makes}].
\par
Given $A = \texttt{coding}$, $B = \texttt{practice}$, return 3.
\par
Given $A = \texttt{makes}$, $B = \texttt{coding}$, return 1.
\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
\item You may assume that $A$ does not equal to $B$, and $A$ and $B$ are both in the list.
\end{itemize}
