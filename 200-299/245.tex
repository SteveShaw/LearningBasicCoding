\section{245 --- Shortest Word Distance III}
This is a follow up of \textbf{242 --- Shortest Word Distance}. The only difference is now $A$ could be the same as $B$.
\par
Given a list of words $W$ and two words $A$ and $B$, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
\par
$A$ and $B$ may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.
\par
For example,
\par
Assume that $W = [\texttt{practice}, \texttt{makes}, \texttt{perfect}, \texttt{coding}, \texttt{makes}]$.
\par
Given $A = \texttt{makes}$, $B = \texttt{coding}$, return 1.
\par
Given $A = \texttt{makes}$, $B = \texttt{makes}$, return 3.
\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
\item You may assume $A$ and $B$ are both in the list.
\end{itemize}
