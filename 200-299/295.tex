\section{295 --- Find Median from Data Stream}
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.
\par
For example,
\par
$[2,3,4]$, the median is 3
\par
$[2,3]$, the median is $(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5$
\par
Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
// Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
void addNum(int num);
// Return the median of all elements so far. 
double findMedian(); 
\end{lstlisting}
 

\paragraph{Example:}

\begin{flushleft}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
addNum(1);
addNum(2);
findMedian(); //1.5
addNum(3); 
findMedian(); // 2
\end{lstlisting}
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Follow up:}

\begin{itemize}
\item If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
\item If 99\% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
\end{itemize}
