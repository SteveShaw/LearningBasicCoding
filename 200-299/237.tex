\section{237 --- Delete Node in a Linked List}
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

\paragraph{Example 1:}

\textbf{Input}:\fcj{ head = [4,5,1,9]}, \fcj{node = 5}

\textbf{Output}: \fcj{[4,1,9]}

\textbf{Explanation}: 

You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become \fcj{4 -> 1 -> 9} after calling your function.

\paragraph{Example 2:}

\textbf{Input}: \fcj{head = [4,5,1,9]}, \fcj{node = 1}

\textbf{Output}: \fcj{[4,5,9]}

\textbf{Explanation}: 

You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become \fcj{4 -> 5 -> 9} after calling your function.
 

\paragraph{Note:}

\begin{itemize}
\item The linked list will have at least two elements.
\item All of the nodes' values will be unique.
\item The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
\item Do not return anything from your function.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Swap}
Copy the next node's value to the deleted node and delete next node.

\setcounter{lstlisting}{0}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc, caption={Swap}]
void deleteNode( ListNode* node )
{
    //copy node->next's value
    //to node
    auto p( node->next );
    node->val = p->val;
    //delete node->next
    node->next = p->next;
    p->next = nullptr;
    delete p;
}
\end{lstlisting}
