\section{248 --- Strobogrammatic Number III}
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).
\par
Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of $[L,H]$
\par
\paragraph{Example:}
\begin{flushleft}
Input: $L = 50$, $H = 100$
\\
Output: 3 
\\
Explanation: 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Because the range might be a large number, $L$ and $H$ numbers are represented as string.
\end{itemize}
