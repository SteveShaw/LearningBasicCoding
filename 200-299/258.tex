\section{258 --- Add Digits}
Given a non-negative integer $n$, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
\paragraph{Example:}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Input}: 38
\\
\textbf{Output}: 2
\\ 
\textbf{Explanation}: 
\\
The process is like: $3 + 8 = 11$, $1 + 1 = 2$. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
\end{flushleft}

\item Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Mathematical Induction}
Starting from 10, the result is 1 to 9 repeatedly. Therefore, the formula is
\[
x=(n-10)\bmod 9 + 1
\]
