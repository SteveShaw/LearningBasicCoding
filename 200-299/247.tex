\section{247 --- Strobogrammatic Number II}
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).
\par
Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length $n$.
\par
For example,
\par
Given $n = 2$, return $[11,\;69,\;88,\;96]$.
\par
\paragraph{Hint:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Try to use recursion and notice that it should recurse with $n - 2$ instead of $n - 1$.
\end{itemize}
