\section{244 --- Shortest Word Distance II}
This is a follow up of \textbf{242 --- Shortest Word Distance}. The only difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. How would you optimize it?

Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words \fcj{word1} and \fcj{word2} and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called \textit{repeatedly} many times with different parameters. 

For example, Assume that words are 

\fcj{["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]}.

\begin{flushleft}

\textbf{Input}: \fcj{word1 = "coding"}, \fcj{word2 = "practice"}

\textbf{Output}: 3

\textbf{Input}: \fcj{word1 = "makes"}, \fcj{word2 = "coding"}

\textbf{Output}: 1
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
\item You may assume that \fcj{word1} \textbf{does not equal to} \fcj{word2}, and \fcj{word1} and \fcj{word2} are both in the list.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hash Map}
We have to preprocess the input strings array, and for each string, get its indices into an associated array.
