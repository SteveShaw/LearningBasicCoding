\section{244 --- Shortest Word Distance II}
This is a follow up of \textbf{242 --- Shortest Word Distance}. The only difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. How would you optimize it?
\par
Design a class which receives a list of words $W$ in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words $A$ and $B$ and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
\par
For example,
\par
Assume that $W = [\texttt{practice}, \texttt{makes}, \texttt{perfect}, \texttt{coding}, \texttt{makes}]$.
\par
Given $A = \texttt{coding}$, $B = \texttt{practice}$, return 3.
\par
Given $A = \texttt{makes}$, $B = \texttt{coding}$, return 1.
\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
\item You may assume that $A$ does not equal to $B$, and $A$ and $B$ are both in the list.
\end{itemize}
