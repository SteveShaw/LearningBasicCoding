\section{256 --- Paint House}
There are a row of $n$ houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a $n \times 3$ cost matrix $C$. For example, $C[0][0]$ is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; $C[1][2]$ is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on. Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All costs are positive integers.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dynamic Programming}
需要维护一个二维的动态数组$F$，其中$F[i][j]$表示刷到第$i+1$房子用颜色$j$的最小花费. The DP formula will be

$F[i][j] = F[i][j] + \min(F[i - 1][\bmod((j + 1), 3)], dp[i - 1][\bmod((j + 2),3)])$

But we can directly use give \fcj{costs} array.

\setcounter{lstlisting}{0}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc, caption={DP}]
int minCost( vector<vector<int>>& costs )
{
    if( costs.empty() )
    {
        return 0;
    }
    for( size_t i = 1; i < costs.size(); ++i )
    {
        costs[i][0] += ( min )( costs[i - 1][1], costs[i - 1][2] );
        costs[i][1] += ( min )( costs[i - 1][0], costs[i - 1][2] );
        costs[i][2] += ( min )( costs[i - 1][1], costs[i - 1][0] );
    }
    const auto& last = costs.back();
    return ( min )( ( min )( last[0], last[1] ), last[2] );
}
\end{lstlisting}
