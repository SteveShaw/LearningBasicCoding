\section{256 --- Paint House}
There are a row of $n$ houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
\par
The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a $n \times 3$ cost matrix $C$. For example, $C[0][0]$ is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; $C[1][2]$ is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on. Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All costs are positive integers.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dynamic Programming}
\begin{itemize}
\item 需要维护一个二维的动态数组$F$，其中$F[i][j]$表示刷到第$i+1$房子用颜色$j$的最小花费
\end{itemize}
