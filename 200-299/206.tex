\section{206 --- Reverse Linked List}
A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
\subsection{Iterative}
Starting from the beginning, for each node
\begin{itemize}
    \item Save its \texttt{next} to a temporary variable $\alpha$
    \item Change its \texttt{next} to previous node
    \item Move to $\alpha$
\end{itemize}
\setcounter{lstlisting}{0}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc, caption={Iterative}]
ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head)
{

    ListNode* pre = nullptr;
    
    auto cur = head;
    
    while(cur)
    {
        auto next = cur->next;
        cur->next = pre;
        pre = cur;
        cur = next;
    }
    
    return pre;

}
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Recursion}
The recursive version is slightly trickier and the key is to work backwards. Assume that the rest of the list had already been reversed, now how to reverse the front part?
\par
Assumes the list is 
\par
$n_1\to\ldots\to n_{k-1}\to n_k\to n_{k+1}\to\ldots\to n_m\to \varnothing$
\par
Assume from node $n_{k+1}$ to $n_m$ has been reversed and now at node $n_{k}$, as shown below
\par
$n_1\to\ldots\to n_{k-1}\to \mathbf{n_k}\to n_{k+1}\longleftarrow\ldots\longleftarrow n_m$
\par
What need to do is change $n_{k+1}$'s \texttt{next} to point to $n_k$, therefore
\par
$n_k.\texttt{next}.\texttt{next}\gets n_k$
\par
An important note is that $n_1$'s \texttt{next} must point to $\varnothing$. Otherwise, the linked list has a cycle in it.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc, caption={Recursion}]
ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head)
{
    if(!head ||(!head->next))
    {
        return head;
    }
    
    auto p = reverseList(head->next);
    
    head->next->next = head;
    
    head->next = nullptr;
    
    return p;
}
\end{lstlisting}
