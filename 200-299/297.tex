\section{297 --- Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree}
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
\par
Design an algorithm to \textbf{serialize} and \textbf{deserialize} a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

\paragraph{Example: }

\begin{flushleft}
You may serialize the following tree:
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}
[mynode/.style={draw,circle,minimum size=5mm, fill=gray!20!}]
\node(){};
\node[mynode](a) {1};
\node[mynode](b)[below=8mm of a, xshift=-8mm] {2};
\node[mynode](c)[below=8mm of a, xshift=8mm] {3};
\node[mynode](d)[below=8mm of c, xshift=-6mm] {4};
\node[mynode](e)[below=8mm of c, xshift=6mm] {5};
\draw (a) -- (b);
\draw (a) -- (c);
\draw (c) -- (d);
\draw (c) -- (e);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
as ( 1, 2, 3, \texttt{null}, \texttt{null}, 4, 5 )
\end{flushleft}
\par
\paragraph{Clarification:}
\begin{flushleft}
The above format is the same as how \textbf{LeetCode} serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
\end{flushleft}
\par
\paragraph{Note:}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
\end{itemize}
