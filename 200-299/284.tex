\section{284 --- Peeking Iterator}
Given an Iterator class interface with methods: \texttt{next}() and \texttt{hasNext}(), design and implement a \textbf{PeekingIterator} that support the \texttt{peek}() operation --- it essentially \texttt{peek}() at the element that will be returned by the next call to \texttt{next}().

\paragraph{Example:}

\begin{flushleft}
Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: $[1,2,3]$.
\\
Call \texttt{next}() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
\\
Now you call \texttt{peek}() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling \texttt{next}() after that still return 2. 
\\
You call \texttt{next}() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. 
\\
Calling \texttt{hasNext}() after that should return \texttt{false}.
\end{flushleft}

\paragraph{Follow up:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?
\end{itemize}
